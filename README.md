# keptn
keptn is a fabric for cloud-native lifecycle automation at enterprise scale. In its first version it provides an automated setup of the keptn core components as well as a demo application. Also included are three preconfigured use cases for the demo application: automated quality gates, runbook automation, and automated evaluation of blue/green deployments.

To get started with keptn, please proceed to the [Getting Started](./GettingStarted.md) section. You can find the current release notes [here](./releasenotes/releaseNotes_V0.1.md). We're already designing the architecture and use cases for the next releases - you can find the current design docs [here](./designDocs): please feel free to review and comment the designs, after all, we're encouraging all of you to collaborate on keptn.
