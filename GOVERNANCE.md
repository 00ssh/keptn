# Governance


This document describes the governance process under which the Keptn project will manage this repository.

## Code of Conduct

The Keptn project abides by its [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

As a member of the Keptn project, you represent the project and your fellow contributors. We value our community tremendously and we'd like to keep cultivating a friendly and collaborative environment for our contributors and users. We want everyone in the community to have positive experiences.

## Meetings

- Keptn currently hosts [weekly community meetings](https://github.com/keptn/community#%EF%B8%8F-community-meetings) that are open to the public. 
- The meetings serve as a primary source to present, discuss and review PRs that have been merged or are in the process of being merged to the Keptn project. 
- It is strongly suggested and encouraged that offline reviews are undertaken to gauge the group's opinion on the proposed change prior to the meeting. Comments on the PRs will foster communication and might accelerate and ease the review process.
- During meetings, priority will be given to PRs that appear to need disucssion over those that can be handled offline. 
- Not every PR has to be discussed in an online meeting to be merged. 
- Non-substantial PRs (e.g., fixing of typos, small bug fixes) might be processed offline without being mentioned in an online meeting.

## Contributing 

The process of contributing to Keptn is described in [its own document](./CONTRIBUTING.md). We encourage you taking a look at it before opening a PR.

The document explains in detail how to get started, and describes the process for getting your change merged into the Keptn project.

### Keptn Enhancement Proposals

Proposing new functionality to Keptn is done via so called [Keptn Enhancement Proposals (KEP)] (https://github.com/keptn/enhancement-proposals). This is required when it is intended to introduce new behaviour, change desired behaviour, or otherwise modify requirements of Keptn.

If all you want to propose is a simple addition to a Keptn-service or the CLI, or even a bugfix, you can just [open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/new/choose).

## Membership

The Keptn community membership is defined in its [separate document](https://github.com/keptn/community/blob/keptn-community-membership/COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP.md) **TODO: update link once merged**. 

The Keptn project maintains three levels of membership with increasing responsibilities. The three levels as well as the requirements are described in the more detail in the linked document.

The Keptn project also awards [Keptn community rockstars](https://github.com/keptn/community/blob/master/community-rockstar.md) quartarly. This award does not come with additional responsibilities or additional permissions on the project, it is in fact an appreciation from the Keptn community for individual members that have been showing their excellence in the Keptn community.

## Handling Security Vulnerabilities

**TODO**

The process for handling any security vulnerabilities or concerns found in the Keptn project [is described here](./SECURITY.md). 

## Releases

**TODO** 

Currently Keptn does not have fixed release schedule, instead a new Keptn version is released once substantial new features, bug fixes, and security hardenings have been merged into the master branch. 

Each repository has its own release process. We are in the process of making the release instructions publicly available. Only maintainers can do the releases.

Releases are cut from release branches which are created just before the release. A release candidate (RC) is published for major and minor version increments.
