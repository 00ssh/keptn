## Report a Vulnerability 
Weâ€™re extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the Keptn Open Source Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community members.

To make a report, submit your vulnerability to the private keptnProject+security@gmail.com list that distributes it to the security contacts of the Keptn project. This allows triage and handling of the vulnerability with standardized response times.


### When Should I Report a Vulnerability? 
- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Keptn
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Keptn
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Keptn depends on. For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there.

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?
- You need help tuning Keptn components for security
- You need help applying security related updates
- Your issue is not security related


## Security Vulnerability Response
Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by the security contacts within 5 working days. This will set off the [Security Release Process](#process).

Any vulnerability information shared with the Keptn security contacts stays within Keptn project and will not be disseminated to other projects unless it is necessary to get the issue fixed.


## Public Disclosure Timing
A public disclosure date is negotiated by the Keptn Security Committee and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known) to a few weeks. For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days. The Keptn Security Committee holds the final say when setting a disclosure date.
